--------------
The Classical Concepts: shapes and playstation markers with raidwide damage
	same playstation markers tether together, stand next to each other to maintain tether. 
	each playstation pair: one player will be marked alpha, the other beta.
	various blocks appear in a 4x3 grid on the arena 
		4 blue blocks (octagonal thing): no function, serve as visual landmarks
		4 red blocks (triangle): must be tethered to alpha players
		4 yellow (cube): must be tethered to beta players
	when tether timer runs out, players receive damage but survive if tethered to the correct block.
	all blocks then do chariot. stand between them. 
	Palladian Ray: 
		The boss slams her 2 spikes on the left and right side of the arena. 
		The 4 closest players to each spike get targeted for a persistent cone aoe that is baited like twister. They will receive the initial hit but walk out of the cone.

Ultima

Crush Helm: double tank busters multihit
	Tanks receive a stacking debuff that hits 4 times
	Healers must esuna the debuff off after 4 hits 
	The boss then does one more big hit a final time after
	Kitchen sink CDs
-------------
Caloric Theory
	Arena appearance change 
	2 Players receive a red mark above their head. Stack together center. 
	When the castbar finishes, raidwide damage and debuffs go out:
		4 players get 2 stack fire and one blue debuff
		4 players get 1 stack fire and one red debuff 
	Goal: when the blue debuff runs out, blue debuff players must have 4 stacks of fire to soak the aero solo
	Rules: 
		players with the red mark above their head must soak with a partner 
		players with blue debuff must have 4 stacks to soak aero solo
	Sequence: 
		Boss casts Caloric Theory
		2 people get red marks above their head. Stack together. 
		Boss finishes casting Caloric Theory, raidwide dmg goes out and debuffs go out
		People with red mark above their head stay put. People on the outside without marks locate a red mark clockwise from them and stack. People in the center fill the 2 remaining red marks afterward and stack. 
		All players receive 2 man stack damage 
		Players with 4 fire stack and blue debuff stay put. 
		Players with 3 stacks move literally anywhere else. 
		Players who have the remaining 2 red marks above the head find the 3 stack players from above and stack. 
		Aero and 2 man stacks resolve simultaneously. 

--------------
Ekpyrosis: exaflares and quickmarch 
	Party splits in half to dodge the proximity AOEs 
	All players note exaflare starting positions and stand at the edge to dodge them.
	All players spread out in a line in on their respective sides to soak solo aoes 
	All players re-converge on the initial exaflare positions and use that reference point to walk back to center 
	All players receive healing for incoming raidwide while dodging residual exaflares 

Ultima
---------------
Pangenesis: 
	Chain/DNA debuff: 4 players receive 2 stacks, two players receive 1 stack, two players receive no stacks
		All stacks must be removed by the end of the timer 
		Stacks are removed by having a partner who is -1 stack than you. The person with the highest stack # loses one stack but the other maintains. Ex: 2 stack stands with 1 stack, the result is two people with 1 stack. 
		1 stack stands with no stack and that results with two people with no stack. 
	1 player receives short red/dark debuff
	1 player receives long red/dark debuff
	1 player receives short white debuff
	1 player receives long white debuff 
	Goal: Soak towers and remove chain debuff off all players by the end of debuff timer. 
	Sequence: 
		Boss casts Pangenesis 
		All players form a conga long horizontally 
		Debuffs go out
		2 chains move forward from the conga, 1 chains stay, no chains move backward 
		Pantheos cast signaling tower appearance. 
		1s and short debuffs take the first tower set (one west, one east)
		First tower resolves and their are now 2 active white debuffs and 2 active dark/red
		There are also now 4 players without color debuffs
		Second set of towers appear 
		Color debuff players go into the tower opposite their color 
		No color players go into any tower with colored players. 
		Second towers resolve 
		All chain debuffs should be gone at this point as well as colors. 
		6 players will have purple debuffs and 2 have nothing
		Nothings will grab all the tethers left and right respectively then go to the corner 
		Rest of the party goes south
		Tank takes a buster at the same time 

Palladian Grasp: tank buster during tethers at the end of Pangenesis 
---------------
The Classical Concepts 2: 
	LITERALLY the exact same as Classical Concepts 1 however: 
	Boss Casts Panta Rhei
		The shapes will all appear in new positions and you must preposition yourself so you end up at the blue blocks when they appear and solve for alpha/beta debuffs. 
		The way this works is that the boss "rotates" the entire arena 180 degrees (not literally, just the blocks)
	Sequence: 
		Players go to their initial blue block position and solve for their alpha/beta. 
		Once solved, immediately start mentally rotating the arena 180 degrees while the boss casts Panta Rhei 
		Move to the new position of your blue block where it WILL BE after they rotate 180 degrees BEFORE Panta Rhei completes 
		Panta Rhei completes 
		Blocks appear in their new position and players should already be on their blue
		Player tethers go away
		Blocks tether to the player to solve for alpha/beta debuffs 
		Boss casts Palladian Ray and players move to get ready to bait twister cleaves 
		Players dodge cleave and then dodge chariot from the blocks

Crush Helm
---------------
Caloric Theory 2: Every debuff looks like red/fire so this may be confusing to read, open a video to follow along. 
	Boss casts Caloric Theory 
	1 person gets red mark, remaining 7 get greeen. Red mark stands middle and stays there for most of the mechanic. 
	Cast finishes, raidwide damage goes out. All players get green debuff. The player who had the red overhead gets 3 fire stacks, remaining 7 players have 2 fire stacks. 
	The player who has the 3 fire stacks remains middle. 
	1 Player is randomly selected to get a new overhead fire mark. This player receives 8 stacks of fire. This acts like a rot debuff that goes down by 1 for every pass. This rot also causes the fire stacks to increase by 1 periodically so the rot must be passed when each player hits 4 fire stacks (so they may soak aero at the end). 
	The rot also causes baited aoe under the player's feet.
	Pass the rot clockwise such that all players have 4 fire stacks when they pass off their rot. 
	The player in the center (who has 3 stacks) receives the rot last and it will run out as they get their 4th stack. 
	All players solo aero
