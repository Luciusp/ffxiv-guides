### Jury Overruling:
- protean
- if purple, each player has dynamo. If gold, big twisters
- if purple, requires duo stack inside the dynamo (rotate CW to color partner).
- If gold light party stack (run in after dodging twister) [Clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/CrowdedUglyPorcupineNotLikeThis-UpF6m0b-HltItUBd){:target="_blank"}

### Upheld Overruling
- Tethers a player. If purple, huge aoe tb. If gold, full party stack
- If purple, follows with dynamo, if gold follows with chariot
- light party soaks

### Divisive Overruling
- Dashes across the arena in direction he's facing
- If purple, be on the sides, then go in. Stack duo
- If gold go out, light party stack

### Styx
- Massive raid damage stack

### Arcane Revelation
- Creates mirrors/orbs. Mirrors/orbs of the same color that boss glows will fire beams across the arena / explode if touched
- Combos with Dismissal Overruling

### Dismissal Overrulling
- If purple, get knocked out, walk back in and duo stack
- If gold, get knocked out, stay out and light party stack

### Shadowed Messenger
- Creates clones around the arena (sw, se?)
- One channels light, one channels dark
- All of them are casting Divisive Overruling, but the main boss is delayed
- Stay mid, determine safe spots based on combination of light/dark + plus if duo/party stack if main boss is purple/gold
- As clones go across, new set of clones spawn that tether to players. Either gold or purple. Same rules as Upheld Overruling above. If purple, take alone (always tank?). If gold, stack.
- Boss will jump then do Divisive overruling, so watch save spot for that

### Lightstream
- Rotating AOEs. find safe spot
- Combos with Divisive Judgement

### Dark and Light
- Puts a tether on each player (light parties)
- Opposite colors stand together
- Same colors stretch (tether graphic will change)
- Combos with Arcane Revelation
- 2x purple and 2x gold orbs will spawn. The first set to explode will be the color the boss glowed will casting Arcane Revelation
- Will then cast Jury Overruling
- If gold, protean => bait => light party stack OUT
- If purple, resolve as normal?
- in either case, close partners have to go to the edge of the arena
- Casts Divisive Overruling
- Casts Emissary's Will to clear the tethers

### Dark Current
- Triple Exaflares down the room that follow the rotation of the beam of light on the second ring
- Every player gets a big AOE. Light parties on both sides to have enough room

### Letter of the Law
- Two clones come down
- Casts Twofold Revelation (functionally identical to Arcane Revelation, but it spawns both orbs and mirrors simultaneously). Safe color is the opposite of whatever he was glowing when he cast Twofold Revelation.
- Clones begin to cast Upheld Ruling (gold/purple) while orbs (cards) and mirrors spawn
- Orbs and mirrors go off at the same time
- Duo stack towers spawn in intercards
- Clones resolve their mechanic
- Two more clones spawn and begin casting Decisive Ruling

**Resolution:**
Identify which color orb is safe and have all but the tethered tank go to one; the tank will go to other one. Make sure you will not be clipped by a mirror once you arrive.

Once the mirrors go off, the tethered tank needs to immediately move center to tank their tether. The party will soak their tether and move into the safe spot the tank made in the middle.

Parties then pair up and take towers. Use proteans and CW float to make sure each tower has two people. While in the towers, pay attention to where the safe spot is going to be for the two clones that are casting Divisive Ruling.

Resolve Dismissive Overruling from the main boss as normal.
