Eunomia (bleed)

IF PURPLE => duo stacks
IF YELLOW => light party stacks

jury overruling:
- protean
- if purple, each player has dynamo. If gold, big twisters
- if purple, requires duo stack inside the dynamo (rotate CW to color partner). [Clip]()
- If gold light party stack (run in after dodging twister) [Clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/CrowdedUglyPorcupineNotLikeThis-UpF6m0b-HltItUBd)

Upheld Overruling
- Tethers a player. If purple, take alone. If gold, full party stack
- If purple, follows with dynamo, if gold follows with chariot
- light party soaks

Divisive Overruling
- Dashes across the arena in direction he's facing
- If purple, be on the sides, then go in. Stack duo
- If gold go out, light party stack

Styx
- Massive raid damage stack

Arcane Revelation
- Creates mirrors. Mirrors will fire the same color that boss glows
- Combos with Dismissal Overruling

Dismissal Overrulling
- If purple, get knocked out, walk back in and duo stack
- If gold, get knocked out, stay out and light party stack

Shadowed Messenger
- Creates clones around the arena (sw, se?)
- One channels light, one channels dark
- All of them are casting Divisive Overruling, but the main boss is delayed
- Stay mid, determine safe spots based on combination of light/dark + plus if duo/party stack if main boss is purple/gold
- As clones go across, new set of clones spawn that tether to players. Either gold or purple. Same rules as Upheld Overruling above. If purple, take alone. If gold, stack.
- Boss will jump then do Divisive overruling, so watch save spot for that
