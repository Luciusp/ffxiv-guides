## Major Mechanics:
### _Paradeigma + Trinity of Souls:_
**Setup:**
- Creates four orbs each containing a fairy. Two orbs fly out to one side of the arena. A short time later, the other two fly to the other side. The pair that flew out first will fire four beams that need to be baited. The second pair will follow suit a few seconds later.
- Meanwhile, the boss will begin casting Trinity of Souls. Three parts of her wings will light up indicating which half the arena will be cleaved. She will turn 180 degrees after each wing goes off.

**Resolution:**
- Assign one light party to bait the first set of lasers. They will stand in a line from north-to-south or south-to-north with ample space between them so they don't overlap the beams and kill each other.
- To resolve Trinity of Souls, it's easier to think of it as the first cleave is "real", the second is opposite what it says, and the third is "real". So if two west wings and one east wings glow, the safe sides are East, West, West.

### _Paradeigma + Engravement of Souls:_
**Setup:**
- Spawns six orbs (4 blue, 2 red) containing fairies. Blue fairies will tether players with a purple or yellow tether. Players hit with purple tethers will get Astral Tilt (red debuff), players hit with yellow tethers will get Umbral Tilt (white debuff).
- At the same time, the remaining four non-tethered players (two utility/two DPS) will receive either Astralbright Soul or Umbralstrong Soul. When these debuffs expire, they will drop a light or dark tower at that player's feet. I believe tanks always get white, healers always get red. Could be wrong.
- Afterward, the two red fairies will fire beams down the arena.

**Resolution:**
- Have the tethered players form a box by stretching their beam until it is no longer lethal while the remaining party stands in the center of the arena.
- The debuffed players should stand like so around the boss to drop their towers.
    ```
    T      H
      Boss
    D      D
    ```
    Afterward they should immediately leave the towers and find the safe spots between the red fairies.
- Tethered players, after receiving their debuffs, should take the nearest opposing color tower.
