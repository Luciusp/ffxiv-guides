## Major Mechanics:
### _Paradeigma + Trinity of Souls:_
**Setup:**
- Creates four orbs each containing a fairy. Two orbs fly out to one side of the arena. A short time later, the other two fly to the other side. The pair that flew out first will fire four beams that need to be baited. The second pair will follow suit a few seconds later.
- Meanwhile, the boss will begin casting Trinity of Souls. Three parts of her wings will light up indicating which half the arena will be cleaved. She will turn 180 degrees after each wing goes off.

**Resolution:**
- Assign one light party to bait the first set of lasers. They will stand in a line from north-to-south or south-to-north with ample space between them so they don't overlap the beams and kill each other.
- To resolve Trinity of Souls, it's easier to think of it as the first cleave is "real", the second is opposite what it says, and the third is "real". So if two west wings and one east wings glow, the safe sides are East, West, West.

### _Paradeigma + Engravement of Souls:_
**Setup:**
- Spawns six orbs (4 blue, 2 red) containing fairies. Blue fairies will tether players with a purple or yellow tether. Players hit with purple tethers will get Astral Tilt (red debuff), players hit with yellow tethers will get Umbral Tilt (white debuff).
- At the same time, the remaining four non-tethered players (two utility/two DPS) will receive either Astralbright Soul or Umbralstrong Soul. When these debuffs expire, they will drop a light or dark tower at that player's feet. I believe tanks always get white, healers always get red. Could be wrong.
- Afterward, the two red fairies will fire beams down the arena.

**Resolution:**
- Have the tethered players form a box by stretching their beam until it is no longer lethal while the remaining party stands in the center of the arena.
- The debuffed players should stand like so around the boss to drop their towers.
    ```
    T      H
      Boss
    D      D
    ```
    Afterward they should immediately leave the towers and find the safe spots between the red fairies.
- Tethered players, after receiving their debuffs, should take the nearest opposing color tower.

glaukopis: tank buster line cleave twice. tank swap. 
--------------------
superchain theory:  reference clip https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantOilySlothSMOrc-5NOp6xX2BBasqGKa
	engravement of souls: debuffs go out 
		11s white chain: 4 man line stack. stack members must be opposite color. this player absorbs tower opposite their color at the end
		19s white: drops a tower. dropping the tower takes damage of that tower's element color. 
		11s dark chain: 4 man line stack. stack members must be opposite color. this player absorbs tower opposite their color at the end
		19s dark: drops a tower. dropping the tower takes damage of that tower's element color. 
		two 23s white. these people exist just to soak the line stack and the solo stack. 
		two 23s dark. these people exist just to soak the line stack and the solo stack.
		four people also get 21s dark/white: solo stack. appear to be the same people as the 23s white/dark players. 
	superchain blocks: 
		donut: dynamo
		slightly less spikey thing: partner protean relative to the BLOCK and not the boss
		very very spikey thing: solo proteans relative to the BLOCK and not the boss
		orb: chariot 
	rules:
		unsure but: when soaking damage, you require a debuff of the opposite color on you to survive. ex: to soak the white line stack, you must have a dark debuff. 
		following the rule above, towers must be soaked with someone with an opposite color debuff as well. ex: white tower is soaked by a player with dark debuff.
		fucking up block mechanics gives dmg down but not magic vuln so the debuffs are still doable  
	goals: 
		1. do the superchain blocks on the arena 
		2. maintain 4 white and 4 black debuffs on the party 
		3. survive the line stack while maintaining debuffs 
		4. survive the solo stacks and soak towers which all resolve at the same time 
	sequence: 
		1. boss casts superchain.
		2. party visually locates the starting blocks (shortest tethers) and heads there 
		3. boss casts engravement of souls which passes out the debuffs. players note their task. 
		4. party does the first block mechanic (protean solo or partner) and locate the next position to rotate to 	
		5. party moves to 2nd block mechanic (dynamo) and resolves the line stack mechanic
			a. all dark players on one side, all whites on the other. 
			b. the 11s white line stack player stands with the 3 dark players
			c. the 11s dark line stack player stands with the 3 white players. 
			d. line soak goes out and everybody's color flip flops except the people who are the laser
		6. party rotates to 3rd block mechanic (dynamo then chariot) and gets ready to do that and immediately resolve the tower or solo stack after 
		7. 3rd block mechanic resolves, tower players move to drop their towers and solo soak players stand literally anywhere not on other people. 
		8. the two people who had the lasers soak the towers opposite their color.
		9. all debuffs are now resolved and boss casts trinity of souls with no other mechanic for some reason lol 
	memorizing tasks: 
		if you have any multiple buffs 21s and higher, your tasks are 
			1. soak line stack of opposite laser color 
			2. spread and don't hit anyone with solo stack 
		if you have 19s white/dark debuff, your tasks are 
			1. soak line stack of opposite laser color. this provides you the opposite colored debuff (in addition to your starting one) in order to survive the tower drop.
			2. drop your tower not on anyone else 
		if you have 11s white/dark debuff, your tasks are
			1. stand with the group of 3 player colors opposite if your color. ex: white laser stands with the 3 dark players
			2. soak the tower opposite your color at the end 


trinity of souls: just this and nothing else because ???
----------
apodialogos: 2 man tank stack on the 2 furthest players. 6 man group stack on the 6 closest players. 
	tanks stand out max melee and party stands center 
	tanks will receive a dot with relatively low dmg 

OR

peridialogos: tanks center, party max melee 
----------

on the soul

paradeigma: 4 blue, 2 yellow 
	engravement of souls: 
		1 player gets 14s cross. once the debuff hits 0, this player drops a cross shaped aoe directly under them. 
			this player stands at the very corner of the arena to drop the cross
		1 player gets 14s X. once the debuff hits 0, this player drops an X shaped aoe directly under them.
			this player stands at the mid point of an edge of the arena to drop the X
		2 players get white (or black?) debuff. once the debuff hits 0, these players drop towers of that color. 
		appears to all be one role type 
		other 4 players: get tethers from the adds. 2 get dark, 2 get light. these players soak towers. 
	unnatural enchainment: boss tethers 4 tiles to break 
		there's also 4 regular towers debuff players will soak while tether players position to break tethers. 
	yellow adds at the end

------
this is but a glimpse of god's strength!: no castbar raidwide 
	adds will come down to signal it happening. this also signals add phase beginning. 

add phase: 
	all players receive limit cut numbers 1-8 :))))))))))))))))))))
	boss does a straight line dash to players in this order. soak in pairs of 2. 
	each time she dashes, she will leave a bleed puddle on the floor at the player baited positions. her next dash will also start from the last position she dashed to. initial boss position is RANDOM. treat this position as north.  
	an add will periodically spawn in the middle and do a cleave. this can/will be outranged. the 2 closest players will bait lasers like the yellow adds earlier. 
	this entire phase is downtime. focus on mechanics.
	this phase will also be a pseudo mitigation check as damage hits hard and fast. requirements: preshield, three 10%s. reshield/heal inbetween hits. 
	dashes receive 6s magic vuln
	lasers receive 4s magic vuln 
	the corners of the octagon will be the points you bait dashes/drop puddles 

player pairs: 
	1 + 3
	5 + 7 
	2 + 4
	6 + 8

add soak laser order:
	1. 5+7
	2. 6+8
	3. 1+3
	4. 2+4

bait positions order: remember boss starts from random point initally and the ending point becomes the new starting point of the next dash. treat start point as north. 
	1. south
	2. north
	3. sw
	4. ne
	5. w
	6. e
	7. nw
	8. se

after dashes and lasers are done, boss breaks the 4 center tiles and casts theos's ultima raidwide at the end.
