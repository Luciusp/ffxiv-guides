### Timeline
[Fight Timeline can be found here](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/timeline?id=75393810445861). They cleared at exactly 10 minutes in the vod, so I don't know what comes after.

### Major Mechanics:
##### _Dividing Wings / Steel Web:_
**Setup:**
Two winged spears will spawn in the center of the arena. After a few seconds, they will tether to two random players. Once these tethers disappear, each tethered player will fire a lethal 120 degree cone across the map.

Just after the spears come down, a random dps and a random tank/healer will recieve a stack marker. Everyone who takes this stack will be tethered together by webbing. This webbing immobilizes and, a few seconds later, instantly kills anyone who has not been freed. If more than three people are tethered together, the webbing solidifies and cannot be broken, guaranteeing death.

The boss will follow this up with a cast of either Pandaemon's Holy or Circles of Pandaemonium.
Pandaemon's Holy => Middle row is safe
Circles of Pandaemonium => First row is safe

**Resolution:**
_Tether players:_
Have the two players tethered by the spears stand just in front of them, standing between the boss and the spears. You can see the exact spot in the image below. ![alt text](img/dividing-wings.png)
Once the tether is resolved, these players should run backward through all of the webbing binding their teammates, freeing them.

_Webbed Players:_
Designate a player who will float for each light party. They will be responsible for filling in case a single light party gets both stack markers.
Have the marked players stand in the middle left and right of the room while their stack buddies form a line on either side of them. This ensures that the webbing between players is long enough to be broken. Triangles will work too (as seen in the clip) but require more movement.

#### _Wicked Step / Entangling Web:_
**Setup:**
Two tankbuster towers will spawn on the left and right. After the tower explodes, anyone standing in it will be thrown very far away.

Afterwards, both tanks and two random players will be targeted with webbing AOEs. After they go off, they leave behind webbing briefly on the ground. If in close proximity to other ground webs, they will form a path between themselves.

**Resolution:**
Both tanks need to be knocked to sides _opposite_ their light party, otherwise they'll be thrown too far and miss the platforms. Safe spot is below. Mirrored on the other side for the other tank. ![here](img/wicked-step-safe-spot.png).

Each tank will need on partner so they can combine the webs together to make a path out to the side platforms. Have the remaining 6 players on the platform line up in a conga line to decide who goes to which tank.

#### _Pandaemoniac Pillars:_
**Setup:**
Towers will spawn in set locations across the arena. Afterward, the towers will animate and choose to either perform a donut or circle AOE under them as seen below. At the same time, the boss will cast either Pandaemon's Holy or Circles of Pandaemonium.

**Resolution:**
Have each player stand on their assigned tower. Afterward, hover between the first and second rows of the arena. Once the boss begins his cast of Holy or Circles, move to the first or second row and identify the single tower that has purple beams coming from it (as seen above). That is the safe spot.
